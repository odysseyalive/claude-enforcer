# Skill Builder

## Quick Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/skill-builder` | Full audit of CLAUDE.md + all skills + rules + agents |
| `/skill-builder audit` | Same as above |
| `/skill-builder skills` | List all local skills available in this project |
| `/skill-builder list [skill]` | Show all modes/options for a skill in a table |
| `/skill-builder new [name]` | Create a new skill from template |
| `/skill-builder optimize [skill]` | Restructure a specific skill |
| `/skill-builder agents [skill]` | Analyze and create agents for a skill |
| `/skill-builder hooks [skill]` | Inventory existing hooks + identify new opportunities |
| `/skill-builder dev [command]` | Run any command with skill-builder itself included |

---

## The `skills` Command

**List all local skills available in this project.**

When invoked with `/skill-builder skills`:

1. Glob for all `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files
2. Read each skill's frontmatter to extract name and description
3. Output a table of all available skills

### Output Format

```
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| /deploy | Deploy application to staging or production |
| /api-client | API client integration and authentication |
| /db-migrate | Database migration management |
...
```

### Implementation

```bash
# Find all skills
.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

For each skill file:
1. Read the frontmatter
2. Extract `name` and `description` fields
3. Format as table row: `| /[name] | [description] |`

Sort alphabetically by skill name.

---

## The `list` Mode Requirement

**Every skill with multiple modes MUST support a `list` mode.**

When a user runs `/skill-name list`, output a clean table showing all available modes:

```
| Mode | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **mode1** | `/skill-name mode1 [args]` | Brief description of what this mode does |
| **mode2** | `/skill-name mode2 [args]` | Brief description of what this mode does |
```

### Why This Matters

The `description:` field in frontmatter is limited to one line and gets truncated. Users need a way to discover all available options without reading the full SKILL.md.

### Implementation

Skills with modes should include a `## Usage` section near the top:

```markdown
## Usage

```
/skill-name [mode] [args]
```

### Modes

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode1` | `/skill-name mode1 [args]` | What mode1 does |
| `mode2` | `/skill-name mode2 [args]` | What mode2 does |

Default mode is `[default]` if not specified.
```

### Handling `/skill-name list`

When invoked with `list` as the first argument:
1. Read the skill's SKILL.md
2. Find the Modes table
3. Output the table directly to the user

**This is a reserved mode name.** Skills should not use `list` for other purposes.

### Audit Check

When auditing skills, verify:
- Does the skill have multiple modes? → Must have a Modes table
- Is the Modes table in a consistent format? → Command + Description columns
- Does the description mention `list` if applicable? → Add to frontmatter

---

## Self-Exclusion Rule

**The skill-builder skill MUST be excluded from all actions (audit, optimize, agents, hooks, skills list) unless the command is prefixed with `dev`.**

- `/skill-builder audit` → audits all skills EXCEPT skill-builder
- `/skill-builder optimize some-skill` → works normally
- `/skill-builder optimize skill-builder` → REFUSED. Say: "skill-builder is excluded from its own actions. Use `dev` prefix: `/skill-builder dev optimize skill-builder`"
- `/skill-builder dev audit` → includes skill-builder in the audit
- `/skill-builder dev optimize skill-builder` → allowed

**Detection:** If the first argument after the command is `dev`, strip it and proceed with self-inclusion enabled. Otherwise, skip any skill whose name is `skill-builder` when iterating skills, and refuse if `skill-builder` is explicitly named as a target.

---

## Full Audit Workflow

**When invoked without arguments, run the full audit:**

### Step 1: Gather Metrics

```
Files to scan:
- CLAUDE.md
- .claude/rules/*.md (if exists)
- .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Step 2: Generate Report

```markdown
# Skill System Audit Report

## CLAUDE.md
- **Lines:** [X] (target: < 150)
- **Extraction candidates:** [list sections that could move to skills]

## Rules Files
- **Found:** [count] files in .claude/rules/
- **Should convert to skills:** [yes/no with reasoning]

## Skills Summary
| Skill | Lines | Description | Directives | Reference Inline | Hooks | Status |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|------------------|-------|--------|
| /skill-1 | X | single/multi | Y | Z tables | yes/no | OK/NEEDS WORK |

**Description column:** Flag `multi` if uses `|` or `>` syntax (needs optimization to single line)

## Priority Fixes
1. [Most impactful optimization]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Agent Opportunities
| Skill | Agent Type | Purpose | Priority |
|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| /skill-1 | id-lookup | Enforce grounding for IDs | High |
| /skill-2 | validator | Pre-flight validation | Medium |

## Directives Inventory
[List all directives found across all skills - ensures nothing is lost]
```

### Step 3: Offer Actions

After presenting the report, ask:
> "Which would you like me to do first?"
> 1. Optimize [highest priority item]
> 2. Show detailed audit for a specific skill
> 3. Create missing reference.md files
> 4. Set up enforcement hooks
> 5. Create agents for [skill with highest agent opportunity]
> 6. Full optimization (reference.md + hooks + agents) for a skill

---

## Core Principles

**IMPORTANT: Never break anything.**

Optimization is RESTRUCTURING, not REWRITING. The skill must behave identically after optimization.

**YOU MUST:**

1. **MOVE content, don't rewrite it** — Copy verbatim to new location
2. **PRESERVE all directives exactly** — User's words are sacred
3. **KEEP all workflows intact** — Same steps, same order, same logic
4. **TEST nothing changes** — After optimization, skill works identically

**What optimization IS:**
- Moving reference tables to `reference.md`
- Moving IDs/accounts to `reference.md`
- Adding grounding requirements
- Creating enforcement hooks
- Splitting into SKILL.md + reference.md

**What optimization is NOT:**
- Rewriting instructions "for clarity"
- Condensing workflows "for brevity"
- Changing step order "for efficiency"
- Removing "redundant" content
- Summarizing user directives

**The test:** If the original author reviewed the optimized skill, they should say "this does exactly what mine did, just organized differently."

---

**Directives are sacred.**

When a user says "Never use Uncategorized accounts" — those exact words stay in the skill, verbatim, forever.

**YOU MUST distinguish between:**

| Content Type | Can Compress? | Where It Lives |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Directives** (user's exact rules) | NEVER | Top of SKILL.md, verbatim |
| **Reference** (IDs, tables, theory) | YES | Separate reference.md |
| **Machinery** (hooks, agents, chains) | YES | settings.json, hooks/, agents |

---

## The Sacred Directive Pattern

When a user gives you a rule, store it verbatim in a `## Directives` section:

```markdown
## Directives

> **NEVER assign a transaction or expense to Uncategorized or Other Expenses.**
> Every transaction must go to a specific, meaningful expense category.
> If a transaction doesn't clearly match a known category, stop and ask.

*— Added 2026-01-15, source: user instruction*
```

**Rules for directives:**
1. Quote the user's exact words
2. Add source and date
3. Place at TOP of skill file
4. NEVER summarize or reword for brevity
5. Enforce with hooks when possible

---

## Enforcement Mechanisms

See [references/enforcement.md](references/enforcement.md) for hook JSON examples, permission patterns, subagent YAML, and context mutability theory.

---

## Agents

See [references/agents.md](references/agents.md) for all 4 agent templates, opportunity detection table, creating agents workflow, and agent file structure.

---

## Hooks Command

When running `/skill-builder hooks` (all skills) or `/skill-builder hooks [skill]` (specific skill):

### Step 1: Inventory Existing Hooks

Scan for hook scripts and their wiring:

```
1. Glob for .claude/skills/**/hooks/*.sh
2. Read .claude/settings.local.json → hooks section
3. Cross-reference: which scripts are wired, which are orphaned
```

### Step 2: Validate Existing Hooks

For each hook script found:

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|----------------|
| **Wired** | Listed in settings.local.json `hooks` section |
| **Matcher** | Correct tool matcher (Bash, Edit, etc.) |
| **Exit codes** | Uses `exit 2` to block, `exit 0` to allow |
| **Reads stdin** | Captures `INPUT=$(cat)` for tool input |
| **Permission** | Script is executable (`chmod +x`) |
| **Error output** | Writes block reason to stderr (`>&2`) |

### Step 3: Identify New Opportunities

Scan each skill's SKILL.md for directive patterns that can be enforced with hooks:

| Directive Pattern | Hook Type | Example |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| "Never use X" / "Never assign to X" | **Grep-block** | Block forbidden IDs/values |
| "Always use script Y" | **Require-pattern** | Block direct API calls, require helper |
| "Never call Z directly" | **Grep-block** | Block forbidden endpoints |
| "Must include X" | **Require-pattern** | Ensure required fields present |
| "Never exceed N" | **Threshold** | Block values above limit |

**Skip these** (need agents, not hooks):
- "Choose the best X" → judgment call
- "If unclear, ask" → context-dependent
- "Match X to Y" → reasoning required

### Step 4: Generate Report

```markdown
# Hooks Audit Report

## Existing Hooks

| Script | Skill | Matcher | Wired | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| no-uncategorized.sh | /budget | Bash | Yes | OK |
| validate-org-id.sh | /api-client | Bash | Yes | OK |
| orphaned-script.sh | /skill | — | No | ORPHANED |

## Wiring Issues
- [List any scripts not in settings.json]
- [List any settings.json entries pointing to missing scripts]

## New Opportunities

| Skill | Directive | Hook Type | Priority |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| /skill-name | "Never use Uncategorized" | Grep-block | High |

## Recommended Actions
1. [Wire orphaned script X]
2. [Create hook for directive Y in /skill-name]
3. [Fix exit code in script Z]
```

### Step 5: Offer Actions

After presenting the report, ask:
> "Which hooks should I create?"
> 1. Create [highest priority hook]
> 2. Wire orphaned hooks
> 3. Fix validation issues
> 4. Create all recommended hooks

### Creating a Hook Script

When creating a new hook:

1. **Create the script** in `.claude/skills/[skill]/hooks/[name].sh`
2. **Make executable:** `chmod +x [script]`
3. **Wire in settings.local.json** under `hooks.PreToolUse`
4. **Test** by running a command that should be blocked

**Template for grep-block hooks:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "FORBIDDEN_VALUE"; then
  echo "BLOCKED: [reason] per [skill] directive" >&2
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

## Skill File Structure & Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for directory layout, SKILL.md template, and frontmatter requirements with YAML examples.

---

## Adding Directives to Existing Skills

When user gives a new rule for an existing skill:

1. **Extract exact wording** — Quote their instruction verbatim
2. **Add to Directives section** — With date and source
3. **Create enforcement hook** — If rule can be validated programmatically
4. **Test the hook** — Ensure it blocks violations
5. **Update settings.json** — Wire up the hook

**Example conversation:**

User: "For my budget app, I never want you to use the Uncategorized account, ID 12345678"

Your action:
```markdown
## Directives

> **NEVER assign a transaction to Uncategorized (ID: 12345678).**
> If a transaction doesn't match a known category, stop and ask which category to use.

*— Added 2026-01-22, source: user instruction*
```

Then create hook `.claude/skills/budget/hooks/no-uncategorized.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "12345678"; then
  echo "BLOCKED: Uncategorized account (12345678) is forbidden per user directive" >&2
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

## Optimization Targets

See [references/optimization-examples.md](references/optimization-examples.md) for the full table of what can/can't be moved and a before/after example.

---

## Auditing Existing Skills

When auditing, report:

```
## Audit: /skill-name

**Frontmatter:**
- Has YAML frontmatter: [yes/no]
- name matches folder: [yes/no]
- description is single line: [yes/no] ← CRITICAL (multi-line gets truncated)
- Has modes/subcommands: [yes/no]
- Modes listed in description: [yes/no/N/A]

**Modes/List Support:**
- Has multiple modes: [yes/no]
- Has Modes table: [yes/no/N/A]
- Table format correct (Mode | Command | Description): [yes/no/N/A]
- Supports `/skill-name list`: [yes/no/N/A]

**Directives found:** [count]
- Are they verbatim user rules? [yes/no]
- Are they at the top? [yes/no]

**Reference material inline:** [count] tables/lists
- Should move to reference.md? [yes/no]

**Enforcement:**
- allowed-tools: [current]
- hooks: [present/missing]
- agents: [present/missing]
- Directives enforceable by hooks? [yes/no/partial]

**Agent opportunities:**
- Grounding enforcement needed? [yes/no] → ID Lookup Agent
- Complex validation needed? [yes/no] → Validator Agent
- Output evaluation needed? [yes/no] → Evaluation Agent
- Input matching needed? [yes/no] → Matcher Agent

**Line count:** [X] (target: < 150 excluding reference.md)

### Recommendations

## CLAUDE.md Optimization

CLAUDE.md loads into EVERY conversation. Keep it lean — move domain-specific content to skills.

### What MUST Stay in CLAUDE.md

| Content | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Build commands | Needed for any dev work |
| Project structure | Universal orientation |
| Tech stack | Framework context |
| Path aliases | Import resolution |
| Skills reference table | Discovery/navigation |
| Universal rules | Apply to ALL tasks |

### What Should Move to Skills

| Content | Move To |
|---------|---------|
| API integration rules | `/api-name` skill |
| Domain-specific workflows | Domain skill |
| ID/account tables | `skill/reference.md` |
| Vendor-specific instructions | Vendor skill |
| Complex procedures | Dedicated skill |

### CLAUDE.md Optimization Workflow

When asked to optimize CLAUDE.md:

**Step 1: Analyze current CLAUDE.md**
```bash
wc -l CLAUDE.md  # Line count
```

**Step 2: Identify extraction candidates**

Scan for:
- Sections with domain-specific rules (API integrations, budgeting, etc.)
- Inline tables with IDs/accounts
- Procedures longer than 10 lines
- Rules that only apply to specific tasks

**Step 3: For each extraction candidate**

1. Create skill if doesn't exist:
   ```
   .claude/skills/[domain]/
   ├── SKILL.md
   └── reference.md
   ```

2. Move directives (verbatim) to skill's `## Directives` section

3. Move reference tables to `reference.md`

4. Replace CLAUDE.md section with skill pointer:
   ```markdown
   ### [Domain] Integration

   See `/domain` skill for rules and workflows.
   ```

**Step 4: Verify skills table is updated**

Ensure extracted skills appear in the Skills Reference table.

**Step 5: Report savings**
```
## CLAUDE.md Optimization Report

Before: [X] lines
After: [Y] lines
Savings: [Z] lines ([%]%)

Extracted to skills:
- /skill-1: [description]
- /skill-2: [description]
```

### Target CLAUDE.md Structure

After optimization, CLAUDE.md should be ~100-150 lines:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Commands
[3-5 essential commands]

## Architecture
[Brief project structure - 20 lines max]

## Tech Stack
[One-liner per technology]

## Skills Reference
[Table pointing to skills]

## Important Rules
[Only rules that apply to EVERY task]

## Self-Improvement Protocol
[Meta-rules for learning]
```

Everything else lives in skills.
